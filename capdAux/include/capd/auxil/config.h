/// This file contains some precompiler definitions which indicate
/// the operating system and/or compiler used. Most definitions usually
/// should be provided in the command line of the compiler, but if none
/// are given then some reasonable values are determined based on the
/// definitions already provided by the compiler (GNU C++ is supported).
/// 
/// The first section determines the operating system choice:
/// either Unix-like, or DOS/Windows-like.
/// It defines ppDOS for opening binary files with the "ios::binary" flag
/// and other features available only in DOS/Windows.
/// It defines ppUNIX to activate Unix-characteristic behavior of programs,
/// and to suppress functions inavailable under Unix.
/// It defines both for the GNU C++ compiler used in DOS/Windows.
///
/// Then it determines whether the wxWindows (wxWidgets) GUI is available,
/// based on one of the various symbols defined by the wx-config script.
/// If so, then the symbol ppWXWIN is defined.
///
/// Eventually, the type to be used as 16-bit integers and 32-bit integers
/// is defined.
