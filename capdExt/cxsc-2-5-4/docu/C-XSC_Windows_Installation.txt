Compiling from source:
======================

1. Download C-CXSC source code package from http://www.xsc.de
2. Download and install "Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition" from Microsoft
   (or use Visual Studio Professional if available) 
3. Unpack Source-Code to directory "C:\cxsc-src"
   (if you want to use a different directory, you have to alter all paths
    in the project files manually. For the rest of this document, we assume
    you used the default path)
4. Download and install "nsis" from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
5. Start Visual Studio and open the Project File "cxsc.sln" in the directory "cxsc-src"
6. From the Toolbar, select "Release" configuration to compile a final Version, otherwise select 
   "Debug" to compile a developer Version
   (Alter the configuration according to your needs)
7. Build Solution (Press F7)
8. Close Visual Studio and create the installer in the following way:
   -Goto the win32\nsis\ folder in cxsc-src
   -Right click on cxsc_debug.nsi or cxsc_release.nsi (depending on what configuration you build)
    and compile with nsis
   -Double click on "Setup.exe" to install C-XSC


Installing Binary Releases:
===========================

1. Download "Setup.exe" from http://www.xsc.de
2. Install C-XSC by starting "Setup.exe" and following the installer
   (The example project (see below) assumes that you install C-XSC to C:\cxsc)
3. Select "Run C-XSC" at the end of the install wizard to test the library


Using C-XSC in you VS project:
===========================
1. Select Tools->Options->Project and Solutions->V++
   Directories from the menu
2. Select "Library Files" from the "Show Directory"
   Selectbox and add the C-XSC Library Path, e.g.
   C:\cxsc\lib
3. Select "Include Files" from the "Show Directory"
   Selectbox and add the C-XSC Include Path, e.g.
   C:\cxsc\include


Creating your own Projects:
===========================

1. Start Visual Studio, press "Create Project"
2. Select Win32->"Win32 Console Application" and enter a
   Name.
3. Press Ok. The Application Wizard will start.
4. Press Next
5. Select "Console Application", "Empty Project" and
   deselect "Precompiled header"
6. Edit the Project Properties by right clicking on your
   Project Name in the Solution Explorer
7. Add new/existing source or header files by right clicking
   on Source or Header Files (Add->New Item or Add->Existing Item)
8. Add the C-XSC Library on the same way to your project
9. Change Configuration Properties by right clicking on the
   project name (click Properties). Change C/C++->"Code
   Generation"->"Runtime Library" to Multi-threaded(/MT)
   or Multi-threaded Debug (for C-XSC Debug Version)
10. Select "Release", otherwise "Debug" (depends on the
    Library Version) from the Toolbar
11. Build solution by pressing F7


Opening the example Project:
============================

1. Start "Visual C++", press "Create Project"
2. Open Project "myexample" from the subdirectory
   example\project\myexample in the C-XSC install folder
3. Press F7 to build the solution
4. Execute the Binary by startin the command prompt (cmd.exe)
5. Go into the Release or Debug folder and execute myexample.exe
