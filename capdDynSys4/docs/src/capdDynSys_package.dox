/*! \page capdDynSys_package  The capdDynSys package

The \b capdDynSys package contains modules that was originally intended for rigorous computations in dynamical systems 
but currently they are go far beyond this. It consist of the following modules:
- \ref capd::map "map"  - computation of values and derivatives of maps. It is also the core for the solvers in dynsys module,
- \ref capd::dynsys "dynsys" - various nonrigorous and rigorous solvers to ODEs, 
       for computations of the solutions and partial derivatives w.r.t. initial conditions up to arbitrary order,
- \subpage geomset_module "geomset", \subpage dynset_module "dynset" - various representations of sets and Lohner-type algorithms,
- \ref capd::poincare "poincare" - computation of Poincare maps and their derivatives; both rigorous and nonrigorous,
- \ref capd::diffIncl "diffIncl" - rigorous computations of the solutions to differential inclusions,
- \ref capd::newton "newton" - utils related to interval Newton and Krawczyk method,
- \ref capd::covrel "covrel"  - h-set representations and methods for checking covering relations, 
- \ref capd::normalForms "normalForms" - operations on Taylor series and routines for normal forms of a planar map

In development:
- \ref capd::diffAlgebra "diffAlgebra"
- \ref capd::pdes "pdes"
